 * a directory structure containing all the data Finale uses to render a document.
 * The primary EnigmaXml document is in a file called `score.dat`. This is a Gzip archive that
 * has been encoded using the algorithm provided in this class.
 * 
 * The steps to extract EnigmaXml from a `.musx` document are:
 * - Unzip the `.musx` file.
 * - Read the `score.dat` file into a buffer.
 * - Decode the the buffer using #ScoreFileEncoder::recodeBuffer.
 * - Gunzip the decoded buffer into the EnigmaXml.
